Put points evenly spaced across a sphere, given random or clustered
configurations using simulated annealing. The code is implemented in C
and no external libraries are used. Type "make" to compile the
code. The command-line parameters are:

annealPoints - Uniformly distribute points on a sphere.
 -d : Damping factor for the annealing process.
 -i : Number of iterations.
 -n : Number of points.
 -r : Seed for the random number generator.
 -t : Initial value for the temperature.
 -u : Flag to indicate uniform initial configuration.
 -? : This help message.
 -h : This help message.

The results are put into a timestamped log directory and contains:

 - param.log   : the parameters of the simulation
 - sim.log     : the simulated annealing progress
 - initial.log : the initial points in x,y,z
 - best.log    : the best configuration found
